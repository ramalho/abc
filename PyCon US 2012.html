    <h1>ABC: the mother of Python</h1>

        Before Python, Guido was a contributor to the ABC language and 
environment. ABC was designed to teach programming, and had many 
"Pythonic" ideas: integrated dicts and tuples, structure by indentation,
 strong typing without declarations etc. With high demand for Python in 
education, the legacy of ABC is more relevant than ever as we design 
courses and environments for learners.
    </div>
    
    <p><b>Type</b>: Talk</p>
    
    <div>
        <p>If Guido van Rossum is the father of Python, then ABC is the 
mother. ABC was a programming language and environment designed by Leo 
Geurts, Lambert Meertens and Steven Pemberton at CWI in the Netherlands 
during the 1980's. Guido was a member of the ABC team and went on to 
design Python to be <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255835/-z_programming_languages_python" title="Guido's interview to Computerworld, Aug. 2008">"almost, but not quite, entirely unlike ABC"</a>.</p>
<h1>About ABC</h1>
<p>Steve Pemberton's <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/#pls" title="Steve Pemberton's homepage at CWI">definition</a> is the best I've found: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A simple but powerful interactive programming language and 
environment. We did requirements and task analysis, iterative design, 
and user testing. <strong>You'd almost think programming languages were an interface between people and computers.</strong> Now famous because Python was strongly influenced by it. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Why ABC is relevant today</h1>
<p>Guido departed from ABC to create a much more practical, all-purpose 
language. But today Python is increasingly being used also as a first 
programming language in schools and universities. This use as an 
educational tool and as a language for casual programmers can be 
informed by the choices made by the original ABC team, as revealed by 
the language implementation, it's environment, and several publications 
about it.</p>
<h1>About this talk</h1>
<p>The aim is to answer the question: <strong>What can current and 
future Python IDEs and libraries aimed at beginning or casual 
programmers learn from ABC, a language and environment explicitly 
designed for that audience?</strong></p>
<p>The ABC language and environment will be shown live (the DOS binary can be made to work).</p>
<p>The main similarities and differences between Python and ABC will be discussed, often with side-by-side code comparisons. </p>
<p>Among the similarities, we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>foreach</em> style <code>for</code> command, with tuple unpacking;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>block structure by indentation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extensive use of dicts and tuples (called "tables" and "compounds");</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unbounded strings;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ABC also has some features that Python did not inherit:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lists and dicts are only allowed to contain items of the same type;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>variables can only be bound to a single type during one function invocation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lists are automatically kept sorted (the rationale was: you either 
want a list to be sorted, or the ordering of the items is irrelevant);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numbers are either exact (represented as a ratio of two unbounded 
integers) or aproximate (represented as hardware floats) and division 
between exact numbers always produces another exact number (compare this
 with division in Python &lt; 3, and the origin of one of Python's warts
 becomes apparent; but it is no wart in ABC, because exact numbers are 
rationals so 3/2 is exactly 1.5);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explicit files are not supported: instead, the environment auto-saves
 objects like functions and global variables in workspaces for use in 
future sessions; also, table-like global variables can be bound to 
standard I/O, but this binding cannot be changed within a session; </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ABC also includes an editor and interactive console with 
auto-completion, auto-indentation and other aids. It uses the concept of
 workspaces which allows a form of modular programming without explicit 
handling of packages and imports.</p>
<p>The merits of these and some other features that Python dropped or 
changed will be discussed in the context of Python usage by people 
learning to program. For instance, although implicit persistency and 
constrained file I/O may be unacceptable to some professional 
programmers, there are similar features in programming systems designed 
for non-programmers, such as Smalltalk, Hypercard and more recently, 
Processing. </p>

        <p><b>Additional Notes:</b></p>
    
        <p></p><p>I have spoken about Python in international conferences including most editions of <a href="http://softwarelivre.org/fisl12?lang=en">FISL</a> (the largest FLOSS conference in the southern hemisphere, since the year 2000) and at the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2700" title="Session page: From Oracle to ZODB - a case study">O'Reilly Open Source Convention</a> (2002). Some of my slides, mostly in Portuguese, are on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ramalho/slideshows">Slideshare</a>. This is a popular set (3992 views): <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ramalho/python-a-primeira-mordida-presentation">Python, the first bite (in Portuguese)</a>.</p>
<p>I've been a Python evangelist and instructor since 1998, and currently hold the record for all-time posts in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/python-brasil/about" title="About python-brasil @ Google Groups">python-brasil</a> mailing list, with 1727 messages as of today, mostly helping newcomers to the language.</p>
<p>I have written a popular <a href="http://python.org.br/wiki/AprendaProgramar" title="Aprenda a Programar (Learn to Program)">Python tutorial for non-programmers</a> (in Portuguese). </p>
<p>I have taught programming to beginners and new languages to 
professional developers even before my involvement with Python, and I 
have also developed educational software, so the interaction between 
programming and learning is a lifelong inteterst of mine. Recently I've 
run "programming workshops for everyone" using Processing and Python at 
cultural centers in Brazil. </p><p></p>

            <div class="comment"><p>I see the lists.  I'm not clear what
 you are doing with these features.  Is this a historical comparison 
mostly?  What does it it say for what we do with <em>Python</em> now and in the future?</p></div>

        <div class="review-box">
            <div class="comment"><p>Andy, thanks for your interest in reviewing my talk and posing a question.</p>
<p>I believe this talk is attractive from a historical point of view, and will draw an audience for that reason alone.</p>
<p>But I also think PyCon attendees like to learn things they can apply 
directly. I filed this proposal under the "Education" category and it is
 under this light that it should be reviewed (alas, the category does 
not appear in the proposal page, but only in the main review listing).</p>
<p>Today Python is being increasingly adopted as a teaching language. A 
the same time, in fundamental education, projects like Scratch gain 
popularity as tools to introduce programming to kids, by lowering the 
syntactic barrier. Python, because of its ABC inheritance, has one the 
lowest syntactic barriers already (LISP ans Smalltalk both have simpler 
syntax, but at the cost of poorer readability).</p>
<p>While I believe that Python is an excellent first programming 
language, having taught programming to beginners many times I know any 
language aimed at professional programmers poses some challenges to 
learners. For example, the fact that dicts are unordered in Python makes
 sense from an engineering perspective but is a poor usability decision.
 </p>
<p>One strategy to make the language more approachable is to select 
which features to use in examples and exercises. Another is to offer 
more guidance and prevent more errors through the interactive 
environment. A third is to make features that are useful to novice users
 more accessible to them. Studying ABC helps with all of these things.</p>
<p>My main point is that studying ABC, the ABC book and several papers 
written about it, where the design choices of the language are made 
explicit, is valuable to teachers designing Python courses aimed at 
beginning programmers, and to developers creating or enhancing Python 
tools targeting the same audience. My goal is to present a summary of 
what I learned from those sources to the public.</p></div>
