<h1>ABC: The Language</h1>

<p>ABC is an imperative language originally designed as a
replacement for BASIC: interactive, very easy to learn, but
structured, high-level, and easy to use. ABC has been designed
iteratively, and the present version is the 4th iteration. The
previous versions were called B (not to be confused with the
predecessor of C).</p>

<p>It is suitable for general everyday programming, the sort of
programming that you would use BASIC, Pascal, or AWK for. It is not
a systems-programming language. It is an excellent teaching
language, and because it is interactive, excellent for prototyping.
It is much faster than Unix 'bc' for doing quick calculations.</p>

<p>ABC programs are typically very compact, around a quarter to a
fifth the size of the equivalent Pascal or C program. However, this
is not at the cost of readability, on the contrary in fact (see the
examples below).</p>

<p>ABC is simple to learn due to the small number of types in the
language (five). If you already know Pascal or something similar
you can learn the whole language in an hour or so. It is easy to
use because the data-types are very high-level.</p>

<p>The five types are:</p>

<ul>
<li>numbers: unbounded length, with exact arithmetic the rule
</li>

<li>texts (strings): also unbounded length
</li>

<li>compounds: records without field names
</li>

<li>lists: sorted collections of any one type of items (bags or
multi-sets)
</li>

<li>tables: generalised arrays with any one type of keys, any one
type of items (finite mappings).
</li>
</ul>
