<h1>The Advantages of ABC as an Introductory Programming Language</h1>

<h2>ABC leaves time to teach the principles</h2>

With a programming language like Pascal, the experience is that most
of the time in class is spent on the details of the language, leaving
too little time to teach about what really matters: the principles of
programming. Quite possibly, a one-term course may not even get round
to introducing pointers. With ABC, the <em>full language</em> can be covered
in a few hours, leaving ample time to treat interesting and
instructive examples of programming in detail.

<h2>ABC is good for teaching the principles</h2>

Unlike BASIC, ABC is a language that offers strong support for
structured programming, even better than Pascal. Refinements, for
top-down stepwise program development, are an integral part of the
language. Because of the powerful data-types of ABC, including tables
(associative arrays), algorithms can be written at a problem-oriented
level of abstraction. There is no GOTO statement in ABC, and
expressions do not have side-effects.

<h2>ABC lets you choose interesting examples</h2>

With many other languages, including BASIC and Pascal, it is always
hard to pick interesting examples. Especially early in the course,
when only numeric types and arrays have been introduced, it is very
problematic to handle more challenging problems than say computing the
average of a sequence. The lack of procedures at the early stages may
also cause the students to develop bad programming habits. With ABC,
you can treat interesting examples right from the start. Programming
problems involving texts (strings) are as easy to solve in ABC as
problems with numbers. Programs in ABC are often five to twenty times
as short as their counterparts coded in BASIC or Pascal. There is no
distinction whatsoever in ABC between a program and a procedure.

<h2>ABC allows you to set challenging assignments</h2>

For basically the same reasons, you can set assignments you would not
even think about if the students had to program in BASIC  or Pascal.
Here are some examples of instructive problems that students can solve
after only a few weeks, using ABC:

<ul>
<li> Pretty-printing a genealogy tree, given a table with the
	parent-child relation.

</li><li> 	Finding the shortest path through a maze.

</li><li> 	Text-formatting, including features like adjustment,
	indenting, paragraphs, and producing a table of contents and
	an index.
</li></ul>

<h2>ABC is student-friendly</h2>

ABC is fully interactive, doing away with the edit-compile-run cycle.
The language has strong type checking <em>without declarations</em>. The
error messages are to the point and self-explanatory, both for syntax
and for run-time errors, always showing the spot in the source program
where the error occurred. The dedicated editor of ABC, which knows the
ABC syntax and which has a multiple UNDO, greatly reduces both the
opportunities for making syntax errors (no more unbalanced
parentheses) and the time needed for entering a program, thus
demanding less time from the instructor for helping with trivial
problems. ABC programs are automatically displayed pretty-printed,
with indentation showing the logical grouping. The ABC environment is
<em>persistent</em>, meaning that variables (including tables) survive a
session and remain accessible until explicitly deleted.
