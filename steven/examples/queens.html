<h1 class="Title">Eight Queens, More or Less</h1>

<p class="Author"><em>Steven Pemberton<br>
CWI, Amsterdam</em></p>

<p class="Body">I was asked what an Eight Queens program would look like in
ABC. The problem is: can you put eight queens on an (8 by 8) chess board board
in such a way that they cannot take each other. A queen can take by moving
vertically, horizontally or diagonally.</p>

<p class="Body">My first version was a fairly traditional version – for
instance see E.W. Dijkstra's version in the book <em>Structured
Programming</em> – although of course, I immediately generalised it to any
number of queens<a href="#pgfId=457073" class="footnote"></a>: </p>
<pre class="CodeLast">HOW TO QUEENS n:
    DISPLAY n filled {}</pre>

<p class="Body">The command <em class="Code">DISPLAY</em> just displays the
board, which is represented as a table whose keys are the row numbers (1 to n),
and whose items are the column number of the piece for that row: </p>
<pre class="CodeLast">HOW TO DISPLAY board:
    IF board = {}:
        WRITE "No solution" /
    FOR p IN board:
        WRITE "# "^^(p-1), "O "
        WRITE "# "^^(#board - p) /</pre>

<p class="Body">The work of finding a solution for the problem is done by the
function <em class="Code">filled</em> . If the board is already of size n then
an answer has already been found. Otherwise, a piece is added for the next row:
each possible piece is tried, and if one is found that is 'safe'– it can't be
taken by any of the other queens on the board – it is placed on the board (by
<em class="Code">board'</em> ), and <em class="Code">filled</em> is called to
fill the next row. If the result of that call is successful, then that result
is returned, otherwise the next piece for the current row is tried. If no piece
is found, then the empty board is returned, to indicate failure.</p>

<p class="Body">The check for safeness uses properties of row and column
numbers to see if a position is being attacked.</p>

<p class="Body">The function uses backtracking and the fact that ABC functions
can't produce side-effects. See my article <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/%7Esteven/abc/examples/logic.html">Backtracking in B</a>
in the ABC Newsletter 5 for more details about backtracking in ABC.</p>
<pre class="CodeLast">HOW TO RETURN n filled board:
    IF #board = n: RETURN board
    FOR p IN {1..n}:
        IF safe:
            PUT n filled board' IN new
        IF new &lt;&gt; {}: RETURN new
    RETURN {}
safe: REPORT col AND left AND right
col: REPORT p not.in board
left: REPORT NO r IN keys board HAS r+board[r] = #board+1+p
right: REPORT NO r IN keys board HAS r-board[r] = #board+1-p
board':
    PUT p IN board[#board+1]
    RETURN board</pre>

<h2 class="Heading">A More Direct Version</h2>

<p class="Body">However, I also decided to try a more direct solution, by
simulating what you would do by hand more closely. Here the board is again a
table with the row number as key, but with a list of numbers as items. These
numbers represent which positions on the current row are not being attacked. So
you start out with a full board, which must then be emptied: </p>
<pre class="CodeLast">HOW TO QUEENS' n:
    PUT {} IN board
    FOR i IN {1..n}:
        PUT {1..n} IN board[i]
    DISPLAY' 1 emptied board</pre>

<p></p>
<pre class="CodeLast">HOW TO DISPLAY' board:
    IF board = {}:
        WRITE "No solution" /
    FOR row IN board:
        CHECK #row = 1
        PUT min row IN p
        WRITE "# "^^(p-1), "O "
        WRITE "# "^^(#board - p) /</pre>

<p class="Body">The work is done by the function <em class="Code">emptied</em>.
You no longer have to check if a piece is safe or not: for each row you have
just the list of safe pieces available. When you choose a piece, all the
positions that are attacked by this piece are then removed from the board, and
the next row is tried. </p>
<pre class="CodeLast">HOW TO RETURN n emptied board:
    IF n &gt; #board: RETURN board
    FOR p IN board[n]:
        PUT (n+1) emptied board' IN new
        IF new &lt;&gt; {}: RETURN new
    RETURN {}
board':
    PUT {p} IN board[n]
    FOR row IN {n+1..#board}:
        PUT board[row] less {p; p+(row-n); p-(row-n)} IN board[row]
    RETURN board</pre>

<p class="Body">This uses a small function to return the difference between two
lists: </p>
<pre class="CodeLast">HOW TO RETURN l1 less l2:
    FOR i IN l2:
        IF i in l1:
            REMOVE i FROM l1
    RETURN l1</pre>

<p class="Body">As it turns out, this version runs faster than the first
version. The reason for this is that you have to search much less to find a
candidate piece for a row, and when you reach a row where all positions are
attacked, you know it immediately, without having to check each position
separately. </p>
