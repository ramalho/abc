<h2><a name="HDR">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>In his article ``(Extremely) Simple Logic Programming in
      <i>B</i>'' [1], Tim Budd presented a program in <i>B</i> (the
      forerunner of ABC) for solving the ``Farmer, Wolf, Goat and 
Cabbage in a boat trying to get to the other side of the river without 
eating each other'' problem. The problem involves the four named trying 
to cross a river with a boat that can only take two of them at a time, 
with the added complication that only the farmer can row, and that the 
goat will eat the cabbage, and the wolf will eat the goat, if they are 
left without the farmer's supervision. 
</p><p>Tim's program uses backtracking, and in the way it is formulated takes advantage of the fact that functions in <i>B</i>
 have no side-effects, in effect doing the backtracking automatically 
for you. However, the program does have the `side effect' of writing the
 results out as it goes along, rather than returning the result. When 
pointing this out, Tim says: 
</p><ul><p><i>This is a two-edged sword, however, since in some cases 
one would like to modify the global environment and that then becomes 
more difficult. 
</i></p></ul><p>In other words, if the effect you want to have is more than just writing your answer out, bad luck. 
</p><p>The purpose of this article is to show that it is not at all 
difficult to write such a program, both using ABC's automatic 
backtracking <i>and</i> returning a result. 
</p><p>Just for interest's sake, I shall also modify some other aspects 
of Tim's program, to compare how different approaches to data-structures
 affect the program, but this in no way affects the main point of the 
article, which is to demonstrate returning results in a backtracking 
program. 
</p><h2><a name="HDR0">A Solution</a></h2>
<p>First of all, I'm going to alter how the positions of the 
participants are represented: Tim used a compound like (1, 1, 1, 1) to 
represent all four participants being on the north bank: each field was 
the position of one participant in the order: farmer, wolf, goat, 
cabbage; a zero represented the south bank. 
</p><p>Rather than represent north and south by 1 and 0, I shall use the
 texts "N" and "S" (I would have used "north" and "south", but this 
makes some of the lines below wider than will fit on the page). Tim said
 that he chose the integers to make the conversion from one to the other
 easier. For the text representation, we have to alter the definition of
 the function <em>opposite</em>: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN opposite position:
   RETURN {["N"]: "S"; ["S"]: "N"}[position]
</pre></ul>
<p>Just to test it: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; WRITE opposite "N"
<i>S
</i>&gt;&gt;&gt; WRITE opposite "S"
<i>N</i>
</pre></ul>
<p>(Alternatively, a global target could contain the above table, and be SHAREd wherever needed.) 
</p><p>Now a more explicit data-structure can be used to represent the positions, such as a table: 
</p><ul><pre>{["cabbage"]: "N"; ["farmer"]: "N"; ["goat"]: "N"; ["wolf"]: "N"}.
</pre></ul>
<p>Next we need an easy method of altering the set of positions when a 
boat-load goes to the opposite bank. If we represent a boat-load by a 
list of who is in the boat, for instance {"farmer"; "goat"} then we can 
use the following function to take a position and a list of travellers 
and return the new position: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN position altered.for occupants:
   FOR occupant IN occupants:
      PUT opposite position[occupant] IN position[occupant]
   RETURN position
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {} IN start
&gt;&gt;&gt; FOR participant IN {"farmer"; "goat"; "wolf"; "cabbage"}:
       PUT "N" IN start[participant]
&gt;&gt;&gt; WRITE start altered.for {"farmer"; "goat"}
<i>{["cabbage"]: "N"; ["farmer"]: "S"; ["goat"]: "S"; ["wolf"]: "N"}</i>
</pre></ul>
<p>We also need a way to see if a given position is `safe', that is to 
say that the goat is not left alone with the cabbage, and that the wolf 
is not left alone with the goat: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO REPORT safe pos:
   REPORT farmer.with.goat OR goat.out.of.mischief
farmer.with.goat:
   REPORT pos["farmer"] = pos["goat"]
goat.out.of.mischief:
   REPORT pos["cabbage"] &lt;&gt; pos["goat"] &lt;&gt; pos["wolf"]
</pre></ul>
<p>(Notice the shorthand c&lt;&gt;g&lt;&gt;w instead of c&lt;&gt;g AND 
g&lt;&gt;w. Another way of writing the same is g not.in {c; w}.) 
</p><p>Now, the new version of the program to solve the river problem, 
instead of printing out its results as it goes along, will return the 
answer as a value. This result is a sequence of boat-loads necessary to 
solve the problem. 
</p><p>Sequences are typically represented in ABC as tables with the 
elements of the sequence as items, and integers as keys. Elements are 
then added to the sequence with a command such as
</p><ul><pre>PUT element IN sequence[#sequence]
</pre></ul>
<p>so that the first element is stored at key [0], the second at [1], and so on. 
</p><p>In this program, the result is a sequence of boat-loads and so it
 will be represented as a table with integers as indexes, and boat-loads
 as elements. The only difference is that the boat-loads are produced by
 the program in reverse order to how they will be printed out, and so 
the elements will be added at the <i>head</i> of the sequence. This can be done with the command PUT element IN path[-#path], which we can make into a function: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN path with element:
   PUT element IN path[-#path]
   RETURN path
</pre></ul>
<p>An example of a sequence of boat-loads is 
</p><ul><pre>{[-2]: {"farmer"; "goat"}; [-1]: {"farmer"}; [0]: {"wolf"; "farmer"}}
</pre></ul>
<p>representing the farmer taking the goat across the river, returning alone, and then taking the wolf. 
</p><p>The program either succeeds, and produces such a path, or the 
(sub-)problem has no solution, and so it should fail. To represent these
 two cases, the program returns a compound, consisting of a text, either
 "success" or "failure" indicating whether it has succeeded or not, and 
then the path, empty for failure, and the solution for success. (At 
first I had the program only return a path, and used an `impossible' 
path, such as {[1]: {}} to represent failure. I quickly saw this as a 
typical programmer's kludge, and replaced it with the cleaner solution 
here.). To make life easier, let's have a command to print out the 
result (this is just a simple version, it could be made prettier): 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO PRINT result.and.path:
   PUT result.and.path IN result, path
   SELECT:
      result = "failure":
         WRITE "No solution" /
      ELSE:
         FOR move IN path:
            WRITE "Move", move /
</pre></ul>
<p>The original program took as parameter the target position of the four, and then searched <i>backwards</i>
 to see if there was a way that that position could be reached from the 
start position (which was `hard-wired' in the program). It was necessary
 to search backwards, because, like the new version, it produced its 
answers backwards, and so the two backwardses cancelled each other out. 
Another change I have made to the original program is to make both the 
start and the target positions parameters, and to make the program 
search from the start position for a path to the target position. As I 
have already said, it produces its answers backwards, but stores them in
 the result backwards, so that they still come out the right way round. 
</p><p>The final change is that now `allowable' boat-loads are not 
hard-wired in the program, but represented as a list: a maximum of two 
can fit in the boat (it's a very large cabbage), and furthermore only 
the farmer can row: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {} IN allowable
&gt;&gt;&gt; INSERT {"farmer"} IN allowable
&gt;&gt;&gt; FOR other IN {"cabbage"; "goat"; "wolf"}:
       INSERT {"farmer"; other} IN allowable
</pre></ul>
<p>We can now write a function that returns which boat-loads are possible from the current position: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN possible.from position:
   SHARE allowable
   PUT {} IN result
   FOR boat.load IN allowable:
      IF EACH occupant IN boat.load HAS on.same.side:
         INSERT boat.load IN result
   RETURN result
on.same.side:
   REPORT position[occupant] = position[min boat.load]
</pre></ul>
<p>So now, after that introduction to the data-types, we can see the 
program proper. You'll notice comparing it with Tim's original, that the
 main body is more or less the same, except that results are being 
returned rather than tests being reported. The main difference is in the
 refinement to try the next move. Tim's program tried each of four 
refinements until one succeeded. The new version tries each of the 
allowable boat-loads until one succeeds. If none succeeds, it fails. A 
marginal issue is how to treat the case where the aim is reachable, but 
not safe in itself. Tim's version accepted it, and printed the result; 
this version by reversing the order of the first two IF commands, does 
not accept it. 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN position path.to aim:
   SHARE looking
   IF position in looking OR NOT safe position: RETURN failure
   IF position = aim: RETURN success
   INSERT position IN looking
   RETURN next.move
next.move:
   FOR boat.load IN possible.from position:
      PUT new.position path.to aim IN result, path'
      IF result &lt;&gt; "failure": RETURN result, path' with boat.load
   RETURN failure
new.position: RETURN position altered.for boat.load
success: RETURN "success", {}
failure: RETURN "failure", {}
</pre></ul>
<p>(Remember that <em>looking</em> is used to prevent the program 
searching for a solution to a position it is already trying to solve -- 
otherwise you can get an infinite loop.) Now to try it out: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {}, {} IN start, aim
&gt;&gt;&gt; FOR occupant IN {"farmer"; "goat"; "wolf"; "cabbage"}:
       PUT "N", "S" IN start[occupant], aim[occupant]
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {} IN looking
&gt;&gt;&gt; PRINT start path.to aim
<i>Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Move {"farmer"}
Move {"cabbage"; "farmer"}
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Move {"farmer"; "wolf"}
Move {"farmer"}
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}</i>
</pre></ul>
<p>Now to try it with a different aim: the farmer has to get the cabbage
 to the other side (to sell it to the hungry computer programmer who 
lives there): 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT start IN aim
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT "S" IN aim["cabbage"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; PRINT start path.to aim
<i>Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Move {"farmer"}
Move {"cabbage"; "farmer"}
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}</i>
</pre></ul>
<p>Now, finally, the farmer is fed up with goats, cabbages and wolves, and wants to be alone on the other side: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT start IN aim
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT "S" IN aim["farmer"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; PRINT start path.to aim
<i>No solution</i>
</pre></ul>
<p>Alas, poor farmer. 
</p><h2><a name="HDR1">Producing the result forwards </a></h2>
<p>The question arises as to <i>why</i> the program produces the result 
backwards. The answer for Tim's version of the program is that you don't
 know until you've reached the goal whether the current position is on a
 successful path, and so you can't write anything until then. With the 
new version you do have the option of producing the results forwards. To
 do it you have to pass to <em>path.to</em> not only the current position, but how you got to it (as a path). Just to show you how it would look, here is <em>path.to</em> altered in that way. The function <em>with</em> would also have to be altered to append elements to the path, rather than prepend them. 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN (route, position) path.to aim:
   SHARE looking
   IF position in looking OR NOT safe position: RETURN failure
   IF position = aim: RETURN success
   INSERT position IN looking
   RETURN next.move
next.move:
   FOR boat.load IN possible.from position:
      PUT (new.route, new.position) path.to aim IN result, path'
      IF result &lt;&gt; "failure": RETURN result, path'
   RETURN failure
new.route: RETURN route with boat.load
new.position: RETURN position altered.for boat.load
success: RETURN "success", route
failure: RETURN "failure", {}
</pre></ul>
<p>You would then have to call it as 
</p><ul><pre>PRINT ({}, start) path.to aim
</pre></ul>
<p>However, you may notice that <em>route</em> here contains more or less the complementary information to what <em>looking</em> contains. If you represent a path as the sequence of positions, instead of the sequence of moves, you can do away with <em>looking</em> altogether, with the choice of SHAREing <em>route</em> or passing it as a parameter: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN (route, position) path.to aim:
   IF position in route OR NOT safe position: RETURN failure
   PUT route with position IN route
   IF position = aim: RETURN success
   RETURN next.move
next.move:
   FOR boat.load IN possible.from position:
      PUT (route, new.position) path.to aim IN result, path'
      IF result &lt;&gt; "failure": RETURN result, path'
   RETURN failure
new.position: RETURN position altered.for boat.load
success: RETURN "success", route
failure: RETURN "failure", {}
</pre></ul>
<p>This means that you get as output the states rather than the moves you have to make: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PRINT ({}, start) path.to aim
<i>{["cabbage"]: "N"; ["farmer"]: "N"; ["goat"]: "N"; ["wolf"]: "N"}
{["cabbage"]: "N"; ["farmer"]: "S"; ["goat"]: "S"; ["wolf"]: "N"}
{["cabbage"]: "N"; ["farmer"]: "N"; ["goat"]: "S"; ["wolf"]: "N"}
{["cabbage"]: "S"; ["farmer"]: "S"; ["goat"]: "S"; ["wolf"]: "N"}
{["cabbage"]: "S"; ["farmer"]: "N"; ["goat"]: "N"; ["wolf"]: "N"}
{["cabbage"]: "S"; ["farmer"]: "S"; ["goat"]: "N"; ["wolf"]: "S"}
{["cabbage"]: "S"; ["farmer"]: "N"; ["goat"]: "N"; ["wolf"]: "S"}
{["cabbage"]: "S"; ["farmer"]: "S"; ["goat"]: "S"; ["wolf"]: "S"}</i>
</pre></ul>
<p>However, for the rest of this article I will stick with the reverse method. 
</p><h2><a name="HDR2">Another possible representation </a></h2>
<p>You may remark in <em>path.to</em> that there is no dependency within
 the how-to on exactly how a position is represented. What would we have
 to change if we represented it as, for instance, {["N"]: {"farmer"; 
"goat"}; ["S"]: {"cabbage"; "wolf"}}, a representation that more closely
 represents the real state of affairs? 
</p><p>Well, the main change would come in <em>altered.for</em>, which would look like this: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN positions altered.for occupants:
   FOR occupant IN occupants:
      SELECT:
         SOME place IN keys positions HAS occupant in positions[place]:
            REMOVE occupant FROM positions[place]
            INSERT occupant IN positions[opposite place]
   RETURN positions
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {["S"]: {}} IN banks
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {"farmer"; "goat"; "cabbage"; "wolf"} IN banks["N"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; WRITE banks altered.for {"goat"; "cabbage"}
<i>{["N"]: {"farmer"; "wolf"}; ["S"]: {"cabbage"; "goat"}}</i>
</pre></ul>
<p>A corresponding change also has to be made to possible.from. 
<br>The only other thing that must be changed is the test safe, but it 
can be expressed even more simply now, since we can use a list of 
illegal positions: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {} IN illegal
&gt;&gt;&gt; INSERT {"goat"; "cabbage"} IN illegal
&gt;&gt;&gt; INSERT {"goat"; "wolf"} IN illegal
&gt;&gt;&gt; INSERT {"goat"; "cabbage"; "wolf"} IN illegal
</pre></ul>
<p>and then use this test: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO REPORT safe position:
   SHARE illegal
   REPORT NO place IN position HAS place in illegal
</pre></ul>
<h2><a name="HDR3">Multiple paths</a></h2>
<p>An interesting change to consider is returning not just one solution, but <i>all</i> solutions to the problem. Clearly then, <em>path.to</em> must return not just one path, but all paths solving the problem, so we'll call it <em>paths.to</em>.
 In this case we don't need to return the `success' or `failure' 
indication: if it fails, it just returns the empty list: no solutions 
found. If the list is non-empty, then it succeeded. So PRINT will look 
like this: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO PRINT paths:
   SELECT:
      paths = {}:
         WRITE "No solution" /
      ELSE:
         FOR i IN {1..#paths}:
            WRITE "Solution", i /
            FOR move IN paths item i:
               WRITE "Move", move /
</pre></ul>
<p>The main part of <em>paths.to</em> is again hardly different from its
 predecessor. If the current position is where we wanted to go, then the
 result is the single empty path {{}}. If the routine fails, it returns 
no paths, i.e. {}. Otherwise, for each possible new position from the 
current position, it gets all paths from the new position to the aim. 
For each of these paths it adds the boat-load that created the new 
position to the front of the path. Obviously, if no paths are possible 
then it will not add the boat-load to any path. 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN position paths.to aim:
   SHARE looking
   IF position in looking OR NOT safe position: RETURN failure
   IF position = aim: RETURN success
   INSERT position IN looking
   RETURN all.paths
all.paths:
   PUT {} IN results
   FOR boat.load IN possible.from position:
      PUT new.position paths.to aim IN paths
      FOR path IN paths:
         INSERT path with boat.load IN results
   RETURN results
new.position: RETURN position altered.for boat.load
success: RETURN {{}}
failure: RETURN {}
</pre></ul>
<p>And now to show it works: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; WRITE start
<i>{["N"]: {"cabbage"; "farmer"; "goat"; "wolf"}; ["S"]: {}}
</i>&gt;&gt;&gt; WRITE aim
<i>{["N"]: {}; ["S"]: {"cabbage"; "farmer"; "goat"; "wolf"}}
</i>&gt;&gt;&gt; PRINT start paths.to aim
<i>Solution 1
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Move {"farmer"}
Move {"cabbage"; "farmer"}
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Move {"farmer"; "wolf"}
Move {"farmer"}
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Solution 2
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Move {"farmer"}
Move {"farmer"; "wolf"}
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}
Move {"cabbage"; "farmer"}
Move {"farmer"}
Move {"farmer"; "goat"}</i>
</pre></ul>
<h2><a name="HDR4">Solving other problems </a></h2>
<p>Now that the program takes most of its information from 
data-structures, it's interesting to try and solve a different problem 
with the same program. 
</p><p>Consider this one: you have two jugs of different capacities, say <i>j</i> litres and <i>k</i>
 litres. You are allowed to empty either jug, fill either jug, or pour 
one into the other until the one is empty, or the other is full. The 
problem is, what series of actions are necessary to end up with the jugs
 containing <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> litres? 
</p><p>Right, let's call the two jugs A and B, and represent the state 
of the two jugs as a table of their contents. For instance, {["A"]: 8; 
["B"]: 5} shows that A contains 8 litres and B 5. We can represent the 
set of allowable actions (the target <em>allowable</em>) as a list of 
actions, where each action is a compound giving the type of action, and 
the name of the jug. For instance ("Fill", "A"). 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {} IN allowable
&gt;&gt;&gt; FOR action IN {"Fill"; "Empty"; "Pour"}:
       FOR jug IN "AB":
          INSERT (action, jug) IN allowable

</pre></ul>
<p>(The action ("Pour", "A") means pour A into B.) 
</p><p>Now, although strictly speaking, the actions possible from a 
given situation depend on whether the jugs are empty or full, and so on,
 it actually doesn't matter, because if you fill an already full jug, or
 empty an already empty one, you get the same situation, and the program
 ensures that situations don't get repeated, so we don't have to worry. 
Therefore, <em>possible.from</em> is very simple: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN possible.from position:
   SHARE allowable
   RETURN allowable
</pre></ul>
<p>There are also no illegal states: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {} IN illegal
</pre></ul>
<p>Finally, we have to provide an <em>altered.for</em> for the new representations. To be able to carry out the actions like Fill we have to know the capacities of the jugs: 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {} IN full
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT 8 IN full["A"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT 5 IN full["B"]
</pre></ul>
<p>The only unobvious case is pouring: the amount that you pour is 
either the contents of the whole jug, or as much as will fit, whichever 
is less: 
</p><ul><pre>HOW TO RETURN amount altered.for actions:
   SHARE full
   FOR action, jug IN actions:
      SELECT:
         action = "Empty": PUT 0 IN amount[jug]
         action = "Fill": PUT full[jug] IN amount[jug]
         action = "Pour":
            PUT min {amount[jug]; full[other]-amount[other]} IN x
            PUT amount[other] + x IN amount[other]
            PUT amount[jug] - x IN amount[jug]
   RETURN amount
other:
   RETURN opposite jug
</pre></ul>
<p>Obviously, opposite "A" gives "B", and vice-versa. Now to try it (the output format of PRINT has also been changed): 
</p><ul><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT {}, {} IN start, aim
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT 0, 0 IN start["A"], start["B"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; PUT 4, 0 IN aim["A"], aim["B]
&gt;&gt;&gt; PRINT start paths.to aim
<i>Solution 1
Fill A, Pour A, Empty B, Pour A, Fill A, Pour A, Empty B, Pour A,
Empty B, Pour A, Fill A, Pour A, Fill A, Empty A, Pour B, Fill B,
Pour B, Empty A, Pour B, Fill B, Pour B, Fill B, Pour B, Empty A,
Pour B

...

Solution 26
Fill B, Pour B, Fill B, Pour B, Empty A, Pour B, Fill B, Pour B,
Fill B, Pour B, Empty A, Pour B</i>
</pre></ul>
<h2><a name="HDR5">Exercise </a></h2>
<p>Finally, as an exercise, consider what needs to be changed in order 
to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem. If you just use the restriction 
that a disk may not be placed on a smaller disk, it gives 12 solutions 
for moving just two disks from one pile to another! Here's the longest 
(the first line means ``move piece 1 from rod a to rod c''): 
</p><ul><pre><i>Move (1, "a", "c")
Move (1, "c", "b")
Move (2, "a", "c")
Move (1, "b", "c")
Move (1, "c", "a")
Move (2, "c", "b")
Move (1, "a", "c")
Move (1, "c", "b")
</i></pre></ul>
<p>If you add the restriction that the same piece should not be moved twice in succession, you get two solutions: 
</p><ul><pre><i>Solution 1
Move (1, "a", "b")
Move (2, "a", "c")
Move (1, "b", "a")
Move (2, "c", "b")
Move (1, "a", "b")
Solution 2
Move (1, "a", "c")
Move (2, "a", "b")
Move (1, "c", "b")
</i></pre></ul>
<h2><a name="HDR6">Conclusion </a></h2>
<p>Experience with other programming languages can mislead one into 
thinking that because functions in ABC can have no side-effects certain 
practices are impossible. This article has attempted to show that in 
fact this is not so, largely because of the ease of returning values of 
any type in ABC.
