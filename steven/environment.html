<h1>ABC: The Environment</h1>

<p>The implementation includes a programming environment that makes
producing programs very much easier, since it knows a lot about the
language, and can therefore do much of the work for you. For
instance, if you type a W, the system suggests a command completion
for you:</p>

<pre>    W?RITE ?
</pre>

<p>If that is what you want, you press [tab], and carry on typing
the expression; if you wanted WHILE, you type an H, and the system
changes the suggestion to match:</p>

<pre>    WH?ILE ?:
</pre>

<p>This mechanism works for commands you define yourself too.
Similarly, if you type an open bracket or quote, you get the
closing bracket or quote for free. You can ignore the suggestions
if you want, and just type the commands full out.</p>

<p>There is support for workspaces for developing different
programs. Within each workspace variables are persistent, so that
if you stop using ABC and come back later, your variables are still
there as you left them. This obviates the need for file-handling
facilities: there is no conceptual difference between a variable
and a file in ABC.</p>

<p>The language is strongly-typed, but without declarations. Types
are determined from context.</p>
