Before Python, Guido was a contributor to the ABC progamming language and environment. ABC was designed by usability researchers, and had many "Pythonic" ideas: integrated dicts and tuples, structure by indentation, strong typing without declarations etc. With high demand for Python in education, the legacy of ABC is more relevant than ever as we design courses and environments for learners.
