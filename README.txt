ABC Programmer's Handbook

ABC is a programming language designed from the ground up to be easy to use.
Every single thing about it has been well thought out. The result is a
language that is ideal for teaching and learning about programming, but also a
language that is uniquely powerful and flexible.


ABC Programmer's Handbook

The user friendly programming language; powerful and easy to use.

‘An incredibly elegant and powerful language, aimed at non-professional
programmers’ Guido van Rossum – ABC team member and creator of Python

Everybody knows about designing web sites and computer systems so that they
are easy to use, but what would happen if you designed a programming language
with the same goals?

The answer is ABC; a language that was designed on a ‘clean sheet’ with the
goal of delivering an easy-to-use language ideal for teaching and learning
about programming.

ABC is more readable than other languages; no obscure commands. It is more
concise than other languages; equivalent programs written in C are five times
as long.

It is more powerful than other languages; its perfect choice of high-level
data types make it an idea tool for serious programming. ABC was one of the
inspirations for the Python programming language and Python shares key ideas
and features of ABC.

This book provides a hands-on introduction to the language including many
programming examples along with a users guide and a complete definition of the
language. The language is available free to run on PCs, Macs and UNIX. (See
below).

This book is published by Bosko Books 2005. (ISBN: 0954723945)

Download ABC

You can download these implementations of ABC for free. They are  copyrighted
(ie. not public domain), but they are free. This means that you may give them
to – or get them from – your friends.

PC: http://www.idhub.com/abc/implement/pc/abc-pc.zip

This is a new version with much better memory handling than the previous
version. Included are two  .pif  files for running abc on Windows 98 and
Windows 2000. Unpack it in c:\Program Files\ABC (or read the file
readme.txt).

UNIX: http://www.idhub.com/abc/implement/unix/abc-unix.tar.Z

For Unix (These are sources: also compilable on other machines  if you have
the right environment, such as Cygwin for the PC).

LINUX: http://www.idhub.com/abc/implement/linux/abc-redhat-linux.tar

Binaries compiled under Redhat 7.3. See the readme for where to put  the
files.

MAC: http://www.idhub.com/abc/implement/mac/abc-mac.sit.hqx

For the Mac (not tested on newer Macs).
